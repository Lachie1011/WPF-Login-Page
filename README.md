# **A Login Page** <br/>
**This is my first project using WPF, a login page.** <br/> 
I aimed to make a very simplistic yet functional page, using blacks, whites and greys to divide attention appropriately.<br/> <br/>
**Username:** Apple01 <br/>
**Password:** 123ABC <br/> <br/>
**Some of the challenges I faced:**  <br/>
- Setting up the grid in a way that facilitated good use of space.  <br/>
- Getting password box value in order to verify it.  <br/>
- Using the dispatcher timer class to allow for real time and date on the page.  <br/>
- Learning how to use the styles in order to change the mouse over button and textbox effects <br/><br/>

**Improvements I would make:** <br/>
- Have the form connect to a database in order to verify username and password (instead of it being hard-coded).  <br/>  
- Create the form in a MVVM framework such as caliburn micro, if extending the application past the login page. <br/><br/>
